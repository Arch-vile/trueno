Trueno is a API testing tool you can use to poke around an API. Trueno's development is going to focus on the following areas:
- Being great to work with using a keyboard.
- Being great to work with, even in a multi-project setup.
- Being as fast as possible, especially when starting up.
- Creating scripts to customize what happens when you do requests.

## Basic usage:
(More usage info coming later...)
- Press space to open fuzzy finder.
- Press tab or arrow keys to go choose between results.
- Press enter to go to result.
- Press esc to close fuzzy finder.
- Scripts get an object called data.
- You can right click to inspect the web window and debug scripts.
- Good first step would be to console.log(data), so you see what you are working with.
- You can use {ENV_KEY} in request's fields to pull in data from environment.
- Escape { with !{
