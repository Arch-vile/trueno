Trueno is a API testing tool you can use to poke around an API. Trueno's development is going to focus on the following areas:
- Being great to work with using a keyboard.
- Being great to work with, even in a multi-project setup.
- Being as fast as possible, especially when starting up.
- Creating scripts to customize what happens when you do requests.
